# **Helm** - Kubernetes Package Manager

Deploying Kubernetes application which involve creating multiple resources â€“ such as pods, services, deployments, and replicasets which requires YAML manifest file. But this can be very complex.

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is the package manager for Kubernetes. Like any other package managers(yum, apt), Helm provide a standard way to deploy, configure, upgrade, and run an Kubernetes application in a matter of minutes.


You can check [this](https://github.com/C123R/kubernetes-hands-on/tree/master/helm-example/nginx) sample helm chart which can deploy nginx along with service and configmap.
